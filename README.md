```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

## Prescription OCR Feature

The FebreMed assessment flow now supports extracting medication details from a prescription image.

### Backend setup

1. Install system-level Tesseract OCR:
	- Windows: download from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki and install (note the installation path if you need to set `TESSERACT_CMD`).
	- macOS: `brew install tesseract`
	- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
2. Create and activate a virtual environment inside `backend/`:
	```pwsh
	cd backend
	python -m venv venv
	venv\Scripts\activate
	```
3. Install Python dependencies:
	```pwsh
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
4. Set the necessary environment variables (see `.env` for placeholders) and start the Flask server:
	```pwsh
	$env:FLASK_ENV="development"
	$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
	python app.py
	```

### Frontend setup

Keep the existing Vite development workflow:

```pwsh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Requests to `/api/*` are proxied to the Flask server during development.

### Environment variables

Populate the following entries in `.env`:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` / `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` (exposed to the frontend for future Gemini usage)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (used by the Flask backend)
- Optional: `GEMINI_MODEL` (defaults to `models/gemini-flash-latest`, which offers higher free-tier quota than the pro model; override in `.env` if you have access to a higher-tier model)
- `FLASK_ENV` / `FLASK_APP`
- Optional: `TESSERACT_CMD` if Tesseract is not in `PATH`.

### Database migration

Run the Supabase migration to create the `prescription_uploads` table after pulling the latest changes:

```pwsh
supabase migration up
```

### Feature flow

1. Upload a prescription image in the assessment form.
2. The backend extracts text with Tesseract and sends it to Google Gemini for interpretation.
3. The frontend auto-populates medication fields and shows the extracted details.
4. Submitting the assessment stores both the standard assessment data and the derived prescription details (`prescription_uploads` table).
